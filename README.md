The 𝛼th visual sensor’s intrinsic parameters are denoted as follows: the focal length is fc𝛼, the principal point is cc𝛼, the skew coefficient is 𝓁c𝛼, and the distortion is kc𝛼.

Normalized image coordinates are calculated from pixel coordinates by translating to the optical center and dividing by the focal length in pixels
